# Travelling_Salesman
Machine learning to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem

My Undergraduate Research project

I created an interface in javascript and php that allows users to solve the travelling salesman problem manually as a game, 
and using a genetic algorithm that optimizes a customized neural network. 

The code was written to run both linearly and in parallel, by using web workers, to improve runtime. 

I was able to find better results than most of my peers and have a fun UI to go with it.
UI uses a html canvas and javascript to visualize solving the problem in real time. 
URL query parameters can be used to select pre-recorded pointsets and neural network weights, or they can be set to zero or ommited to be randomized on page load.
